# Overview

- This is a collaborative mod for Europa Universalis IV
- I appreciate any and all input about the project, I want this to be something all of us can appreciate
- Add as much content as you can think of! I can flesh out a bad/weak idea but I can't do anything with no idea
- Unless you really know what you're doing with the mod files I'd recommend just adding the stuff to the spreadsheet. If you do feel comfortable with the mod files though, I would really appreciate the help modding
- Nothing is set in stone. A lot may change once the map is actually designed

## How to edit/play

- You can directly edit the mod files through GitHub (look up a tutorial if you're not sure how)
- The mod is not yet playable but when it is, place the sboob folder in \Documents\Paradox Interactive\Europa Universalis IV\mod
- Original game files are located in \Steam\steamapps\common\Europa Universalis IV

## Modding rules

- Make sure any data you add exactly matches the format of the original files
- If you change the name of any value, you need to change all references to that value too
- Please consider changing any names/events that are in poor taste or overly offensive

# EU4 Explained

- Europa Universalis IV is a real-time strategy game by Paradox (who also made Crusader Kings and Hearts of Iron), and takes place from 1444 to 1832.
- In the game, you take control of a country and make decisions regarding administration, diplomacy, and military.
- There many different mechanics and aspects to manage in order to keep your country float

## Geography
- The smallest unit of land is a province.
- A province has a development level, a terrain type, a culture, and a religion.
- A group of provinces is a state, a group of states is a region, and a group of regions is a subcontinent.

## Government
- The vast majority of countries are republics or monarchies, along with some tribes, hordes, and theocracies.
- Each government type also has many different subtypes and different ways of operating.
- No matter the type, each country must have a ruler (You can have a council/oligarchy but they will be represented as one unit in the game)
- Each ruler has an administration, diplomacy, and military rating (each on a scale of 0-6)

## Diplomacy
- There are several types of relations countries can have with each other. The most common are alliances, rivalries, and vassals.
- Vassals are countries who operate independently but are owned by another country. Vassals have their own government and military but must follow their overlord in all diplomacy.

## Trade
- Trade is one of the most confusing parts of the game, but I like to think I have a good grasp on it
- Each province is part of a trade reigon, which it generates cash for depending on its trade power
